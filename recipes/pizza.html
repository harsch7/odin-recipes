    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Pizza is a beloved dish originating from Italy, consisting of a flattened disc of bread 
            dough typically topped with tomato sauce, cheese, and various other ingredients. 
            It's baked in an oven until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly</p>

            tomato, mozzarella, and basil to more adventurous combinations like pepperoni, mushrooms, 
            onions, and even pineapple.</p>
